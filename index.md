I'm Udhayaswaran Ponshunmugam, a software engineer.  

I graduated from Wake Forest University in December of 2019 with a B.S. in Computer Science. At Wake Forest, I was a Richter Scholar, Teaching Assistant in the Department of Computer Science, President of the <a href = "https://www.acm.org/"> ACM </a> University Chapter, and Resident Adviser.  
I'm currently working as a Rotation [Software] Engineer at Nike. I have worked on a variety of teams at Nike, doing a variety of tasks ranging from backend engineering, React web development, infrastructure maintenance, to project management related tasks.

Software engineering fascinates me because of its critical role in empowering people from any background with scalability and flexibility that is unmatched by any other discipline.

I have boundless curiosity and a deep desire to impact people's lives with my skills that I hope to rapidly improve.


Currently, I'm particularly interested in backend engineering that is cloud-native and have an interest in the infrastructure that powers the services that people globally use daily.

In my free time, I like to play chess, work-out, read (currently reading the Tao of Charlie Munger) and skateboard. I also enjoy doing projects related to my interests. Currently, I'm working on building a chess engine from scratch that can understand moves and assess if they're legal. I'm hoping to implement efficient techniques that are non-ML based that utilize algorithms such as minimax.
